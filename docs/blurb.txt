*expak* is a GPLv3_-licensed tool to extract and optionally process resources
from one or more `Quake-style pak files`_.

The main component delivered by expak installation is a pure Python module,
for programmatically working with pak files. The installation also creates a
command-line utility for simple resource-extraction operations.

Currently expak is compatible with Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.2, and later 3.x. It has
no dependencies outside of the standard Python modules.

The expak module documentation contains examples of using the module. Those
examples range from a one-liner for listing pak file contents, up to a
complete script for extracting and modifying map files for use on a CTF server.

The quakesounds_ application makes extensive use of expak.
