Prerequisites
-------------

It's a Python module and utility, so you need Python! If you don't have Python
installed, `go get it`_. The latest stable version of either Python 2 or Python 3
will work. (And if you're already a fan of `PyPy`_, expak works with that too.)

You'll probably also want a Python package manager to help install expak (and
other things). If you're going to be running on Windows, you can skip this
part by downloading a custom expak installer as described below ... although
even on Windows, it can be convenient to have a Python package manager, so you
may want to take care of this anyway.

The `pip`_ package manager is a fine choice for anyone running Python 2.6 or
later. If you don't currently have pip then you can run through the
`instructions for installing pip`_ and be good to go; it can do many things,
but you can ignore all of its complexity for the purposes of installing expak.

Installation
------------

The latest version of expak can always be installed or updated to via the `pip`_
package manager, and this is the preferred method:

.. code-block:: none

    pip install expak

The easy_install utility can also install expak, if you have setuptools
installed but can't or don't want to use pip:

.. code-block:: none

    easy_install expak

Finally, if you are on Windows, you could also choose to use an installer
program, although the methods above work fine on Windows. Custom expak
installers are included in the downloads list for expak
`at the Python Package Index`_ (PyPI).

If PyPI is down, the above installer commands and links won't work. PyPI has
good uptime these days, but if for some reason you do have a problem reaching
it, the Windows installers and other forms of distribution files (including
source distribution) are mirrored `in the releases for the GitHub repo`_.

Another alternative to relying on PyPI, if you have if you have both pip and
git installed, is to install expak directly from GitHub:

.. code-block:: none

    pip install git+https://github.com/neogeographica/expak
