===============================================================

.. include:: docs/blurb.txt

Installation
============

The latest version of expak can always be installed or updated to via the `pip`_
package manager:

.. code-block:: none

    pip install expak

pip is preferred, but easy_install will also work:

.. code-block:: none

    easy_install expak

And if you are on Windows, you could also choose to use an installer program,
available among the `downloads for expak`_ at the Python Package Index (PyPI)
(look for downloads of the type "MS Windows installer").

.. _pip: http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest
.. _downloads for expak: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/expak#downloads
